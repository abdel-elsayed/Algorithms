# Insertion Sort vs. Merge Sort
Implementing Insertion Sort and Merge Sort algorithms and measure the performance of these two algorithms in terms of number of steps and CPU running time.

## Input
For each algorithm, we use an array with number of elements in the array = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 4000, 10000
Measure the running time and number of steps of each array[n] when the input is (1) already sort, i.e. n, n-1, …, 3, 2,1; (2) reversely sorted 1, 2, 3, … n; (3) random permutation of 1, 2, …, n; (4) 50 instances of n random numbers generated in the range of [1..n].

## Output 
The time taken by each Algorithm to sort each array[n], and the number of steps taken by that Algorithm
