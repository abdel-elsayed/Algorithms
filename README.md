## Sorting
1. [Heap-sort](https://github.com/abdel-elsayed/Algorithms/tree/master/Heap-Sort)
   - Comparing mechanism based on a binary heap structure
   - Typically takes O(nlogn) time complexity 
      - This is because it consists of two steps:  
        1)inserting into a heap O(nLogn) & 2) Deleting each item from the heap O(nLogn)
